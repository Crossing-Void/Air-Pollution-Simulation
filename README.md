# Simple-Tk-template

## Preface

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;This is a simple simulation of air pollution caused by burning incense.  
The graphical user interface (GUI) was designed using the `Tkinter_template`.

## Guide

In the GUI, you can see twelve white bar that represents  walls (can click to breaking or building walls). On the right side, you can adjust the CADR value(see your air cleaner infomation) and room side. The big rectangle represents the room area. You can add incense using the incense button and change the air cleaner position using the air cleaner button.

Once you have set up these parameters, you can press the execute button in the menu bar to see the result.
